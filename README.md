<p align="center">
Veiled is a creative coding project that generates abstract minimal artistic outputs based on input sources provided by individuals that represent elements of their lives they keep hidden from society for fear of judgement or ostracization. The goal of the project is twofold. First, to provide beautiful artistic outputs for individuals to display while protecting their story and identity using creative coding. Second, to challenge viewers to consider how they may participate in upholding social norms and values that cause harm to individuals.

Through bravery and self-reflection may we extend compassion and understanding to others so they may extend the same to us.
